# Segmentation

U-Net CNN based model is trained for semantic segmentation on the Semantic Drone Dataset. To prevent overfitting
and enhance the amount of available data, data augmentation techniques are used during training. The modelâ€™s
performance was deemed satisfactory, as it achieved a dice coefficient of approximately 87% on the validation set.
